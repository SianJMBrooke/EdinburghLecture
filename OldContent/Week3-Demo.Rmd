# Week 3 Demo

In this section, we'll have a quick overview of how we're processing text data when conducting basic sentiment analyses.

## Setup

We'll first load the packages we need. 

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(stringi)
library(dplyr)
library(tidytext)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```

## Happy words

As we discussed in the lectures, we might find in our text of the class's collective thoughts that there was an increase in "happy" words over time. 

I have simulated a dataset of text split by weeks, students, and words plus whether or not the word is the word "happy" where `0` means it is not the word "happy" and `1` means it is. 

```{r, echo = F}
## Varying total happy word numbers example

lipsum_text <- data.frame(text = stri_rand_lipsum(5000, start_lipsum = TRUE))

lipsum_text$happyn <- as.character("")
lipsum_text$happyu <- as.character("")
lipsum_text$happyd <- as.character("")

lipsum_text$week <- as.integer(rep(seq.int(1:10), 5000/10))
lipsum_text$student <- sample(1:30,5000, replace = T)

for(i in 1:nrow(lipsum_text)) {
  week <- lipsum_text[i,5]
  happyn <- paste(rep("happy", times = sample(1:100, 1)), collapse = " ")
  happyu <- paste(rep("happy", times = sample(1:100, 1)*week), collapse = " ")
  happyd <- paste(rep("happy", times = sample(1:100, 1)*1/week), collapse = " ")
  lipsum_text[i, 2] <- happyn
  lipsum_text[i, 3] <- happyu
  lipsum_text[i, 4] <- happyd
}

lipsum_text$happyn <- paste(lipsum_text$text, lipsum_text$happyn)
lipsum_text$happyu <- paste(lipsum_text$text, lipsum_text$happyu)
lipsum_text$happyd <- paste(lipsum_text$text, lipsum_text$happyd)

happyn <- lipsum_text %>% 
  select(happyn, week, student) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, happyn) %>%
  group_by(week, student) 
happyu <- lipsum_text %>% 
  select(happyu, week, student) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, happyu) %>%
  group_by(week, student) 
happyd <- lipsum_text %>% 
  select(happyd, week, student) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, happyd) %>%
  group_by(week, student)

happyn$happy <- as.integer(grepl("happy", x = happyn$word))
happyu$happy <- as.integer(grepl("happy", x = happyu$word))
happyd$happy <- as.integer(grepl("happy", x = happyd$word))

happys <- list(happyn, happyu, happyd)

```

We have three datasets: one with a constant number of "happy" words; one with an increasing number of "happy" words; and one with a decreasing number of "happy" words. These are called: `happyn`, `happyu`, and `happyd` respectively.

```{r}
head(happyn)
```
```{r}
head(happyu)
```
```{r}
head(happyd)
```

We can then see the trend in "happy" words over by week and student.

First, the dataset where we have a constant number of happy words over time.

```{r, echo = F}
happyn %>%
  group_by(week, student) %>%
  mutate(index_total = n()) %>%
  filter(happy == 1) %>%
  summarise(
    sum_hap = sum(happy),
    index_total = index_total,
    prop_hap = sum_hap / index_total
  ) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(week, prop_hap)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(week, prop_hap)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks())
```

And now the simulated data with an increasing number of happy words.

```{r, echo = F}
happyu %>%
  group_by(week, student) %>%
  mutate(index_total = n()) %>%
  filter(happy == 1) %>%
  summarise(
    sum_hap = sum(happy),
    index_total = index_total,
    prop_hap = sum_hap / index_total
  ) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(week, prop_hap)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(week, prop_hap)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks())
```

And finally a decreasing number of happy words.

```{r, echo = F}
happyd %>%
  group_by(week, student) %>%
  mutate(index_total = n()) %>%
  filter(happy == 1) %>%
  summarise(
    sum_hap = sum(happy),
    index_total = index_total,
    prop_hap = sum_hap / index_total
  ) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(week, prop_hap)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(week, prop_hap)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks())
```

## Normalizing sentiment

But as we discussed in the lecture, we also know that just because the total number of happy words increases, this isn't indication on its own that we're getting happier as a class over time. 

Before we can begin to make any such inference, we need to normalize by the total number of words each week. 

Below, I simulate data where the number of happy words is actually the same each week (our `happyn` dataset above). 

I join these data with three other datasets: `happylipsumn`, `happylipsumu`, and `happylipsumd`. These are datasets of random text, with the *same* number of happy words. 

The first of these also has the *same* number of total words each week. The second two, however, have *differing* number of *total* words each week: `happylipsumu` has an increasing number of total words each week; `happylipsumd` has a decreasing number of total words each week.

```{r, echo=F}
lipsum_text$lipsumn <- as.character("")
lipsum_text$lipsumu <- as.character("")
lipsum_text$lipsumd <- as.character("")

for(i in 1:nrow(lipsum_text)) {
  week <- lipsum_text[i,5]
  lipsumn <- paste(rep(stri_rand_lipsum(1, start_lipsum = TRUE), 
                       times = 1), collapse = " ")
  lipsumu <- paste(rep(stri_rand_lipsum(1, start_lipsum = TRUE), 
                       times = sample(1:10,1)*week), collapse = " ")
  lipsumd <- paste(rep(stri_rand_lipsum(1, start_lipsum = TRUE), 
                       times = sample(1:10,1)*1/week), collapse = " ")
  lipsum_text[i, 7] <- lipsumn
  lipsum_text[i, 8] <- lipsumu
  lipsum_text[i, 9] <- lipsumd
}

lipsum_text$happylipsumn <- paste(lipsum_text$lipsumn, lipsum_text$happyn)
lipsum_text$happylipsumu <- paste(lipsum_text$lipsumu, lipsum_text$happyn)
lipsum_text$happylipsumd <- paste(lipsum_text$lipsumd, lipsum_text$happyn)

happylipsumn <- lipsum_text %>% 
  select(happylipsumn, week, student) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, happylipsumn) %>%
  group_by(week, student) 
happylipsumu <- lipsum_text %>% 
  select(happylipsumu, week, student) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, happylipsumu) %>%
  group_by(week, student) 
happylipsumd <- lipsum_text %>% 
  select(happylipsumd, week, student) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, happylipsumd) %>%
  group_by(week, student) 

happylipsumn$happy <- as.integer(grepl("happy", x = happylipsumn$word))
happylipsumu$happy <- as.integer(grepl("happy", x = happylipsumu$word))
happylipsumd$happy <- as.integer(grepl("happy", x = happylipsumd$word))

lipsums <- list(happylipsumn, happylipsumu, happylipsumd)

```

Again, as you see below, we're splitting by week, student, word, and whether or not it is a "happy" word. 

```{r}
head(happylipsumn)

head(happylipsumu)

head(happylipsumd)
```

Then if we plot the number of happy words *divided* by the number of total words each week for each student in each of these datasets, we get the below. 

To get this normalized sentiment score--or "happy" score--we need to create a variable (column) in our dataframe that is the sum of happy words divided by the total number of words in the dataframe. 

We can do this in the following way. 

```{r}
happylipsumn %>%
    group_by(week, student) %>%
    mutate(index_total = n()) %>%
    filter(happy==1) %>%
    summarise(sum_hap = sum(happy),
              index_total = index_total,
              prop_hap = sum_hap/index_total) %>%
    distinct()
```

Then if we repeat this for each of our datasets and plot we see the following.


```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}

library(gridExtra)

plots=list()

for (i in seq_along(lipsums)) {
  
  lipsum <- lipsums[[i]]
  
  plots[[i]] <- lipsum %>%
    group_by(week, student) %>%
    mutate(index_total = n()) %>%
    filter(happy==1) %>%
    summarise(sum_hap = sum(happy),
              index_total = index_total,
              prop_hap = sum_hap/index_total) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(week, prop_hap)) +
    geom_smooth(aes(week, prop_hap)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks= pretty_breaks()) +
      theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=20),
            axis.text.x=element_text(size=20),
            axis.title.x=element_text(size=20, face="bold"),
            axis.title.y=element_text(size=20, face="bold"))
}

do.call("grid.arrange", c(plots, ncol = 2))

```

Why do the plots look like this?

Well, in the first, we have about the *same* number of total words each week and about the *same* number of happy words each week. If we divided the latter by the former, we get a proportion that is also stable over time. 

In the second, however, we have an *increasing* number of total words each week, but about the *same* number of happy words over time. This means that we are dividing by an ever larger number, giving ever smaller proportions. As such, the trend is decreasing over time. 

In the third, we have a *decreasing* number of total words each week, but about the *same* number of happy words over time. This means that we are dividing by an ever smaller number, giving ever larger proportions. As such, the trend is increasing over time.
