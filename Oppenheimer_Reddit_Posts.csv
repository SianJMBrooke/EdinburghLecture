RDJ‚Äôs performance in Oppenheimer wasn‚Äôt as great as everybody makes it out to be,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1972tcc/rdjs_performance_in_oppenheimer_wasnt_as_great_as/,"I love RDJ but I don‚Äôt think his performance in Oppenheimer was as great as everybody is making it out to be. His Mannerisms are the same in every single movie. He turns his head the same way, He turns his body in the same way. It‚Äôs very RDJ. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that but his nominations and wins for this role don‚Äôt really make sense to me. I would argue, David Krumholtz performance stood out more in Oppenheimer than RDJ.

And I love Matt Damon but just like RJ they always give the same performances. The Voice is always the same, the cadence is always the same. Their mannerisms are always the same. I think they‚Äôre great actors, world class actors. But for best supporting role this year, I hate to say it, but it should go Ryan Gosling. His performance of that complex role was perfect. I could see everything Ken was feeling on Ryan‚Äôs face at any given point throughout that movie. Even when his physical actions weren‚Äôt portraying the same thing.

I‚Äôm not great with words, but it just felt like Robert Downey Jr. played a role, and Ryan Gosling gave a performance.

And if it doesn‚Äôt go to Ryan, it should go to Charles Melton. His performance was also incredible.

Employee of Oppenheimer & Co passes away. Management couldnt care less..,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1954y7a/employee_of_oppenheimer_co_passes_away_management/,"Ladies and Gents , never put your job before your well being and YOURSELF.
Last week a long time employee of Oppenheimer passed away. Lovely young lady. Was terminally ill. Worked until the day she passed. Cut her day short not feeling well. I will not say her name out of respect for her loved ones.
No one from management attended her funeral. None of them even cared.  They treat employees like trash. Its one thing to pay your employees garbage pay but show some compassion for the people who come to work everyday and hold the company together. Operations is the group that does the actual work.
They don't even talk to their employees. Unless you're one of the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù ones.
The operations executives should not have their roles. They have no people skills.
In this company there is no familial ambiance or camaraderie. They should go around the floor , department to department and take a survey and see what people really think. People dont walk around smiling thats for sure. People retire and dont even get a thank you for your service. People pass away and unless its a friend of management, they wont even get an acknowledgement . They only care about filling the seat again with some person who they will pay poorly.

What are your expectations for the rest of award season? Oppenheimer crushed it at the Golden Globes.

Personally I think this masterpiece has a chance to have a historic run this award season. I do believe this to be one of the greatest films of all time and I think it‚Äôll age like fine wine. the story, the performances, the cinematography, the masterful, edit , the way the film layers themes of unprecedented power both in the form of Oppenheimer individually and the terrifying power of the United States government. I think they captured lightning in a bottle with this one. I‚Äôve seen it six times and I will watch it six more. I could talk all day about more subtle intricacies of this like the Jean Tatlock bathroom scene, or the quick insinuation regarding Strauss and JFK at the end‚Ä¶ what an experience this film is.

There‚Äôs not a ton of strong competition. poor things is picking up steam. maestro is dropping fast. zone of interest doesn‚Äôt have the reputation or numbers to really do anything big. it all comes down to killers of the flower moon‚Ä¶ Despite being an inferior film by a long shot it has the added benefit of both a legendary director and a historical injustice plot line that always goes along way with the various voting bodies.

Oppenheimer is one of the greatest films ever made and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs being talked about enough. I really think everything came together in such a perfect way to make this unforgettable masterpiece.",146,0.99,2024-01-14 03:41:43,42,SarsaparillaNYC

Shin Ultraman is a soft sequel to AoT like how Godzilla Minus One is an Oppenheimer sequel,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/195ji0n/shin_ultraman_is_a_soft_sequel_to_aot_like_how/,"This is kinda a Matpat level crazy kind of theory, however there are some plot points in Shin Ultraman that i feel, are quite like AoT, mainly because of this character in Shin Ultraman

[Mefilas](https://preview.redd.it/0zzmmbw816cc1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=91be9bbf3789b530a7d106a84c7fe59cbe27b499)

Just in case there are people who havent read the manga and anime of AoT or watched Shin Ultraman, there will be slight spoilers for both.

First point might be a stretch, but Mefilas does sound a little like Mephitso, which is a demon's name iirc.

So Mefilas, while he is based on the titular kaiju from the Ultraman franchise, his depiction in Shin Ultraman is quite similar to the devil that gave Ymir titan powers. In what way you may ask?

In Shin Ultraman, Mefilas is the guy who turned Asami Hiroko into a giant that somehow behaves like a mindless titan, except mindless titan Asami Hiroko isnt hostile to other humans. Even her ""titan"" body is as light as a humans, which if i remember correctly, is one of the features of a Titan.

To summarise, what makes Shin Ultraman's take on Mefilas line up very well with the demon that give Ymir the titan powers is the fact that he is :

\-the very first seijin/alien to arrive on earth

\-the only known entity outside the Ultramen who reverse engineered Ultramen Beta energy technology and was able to use it on humans

\-the fact that humans that turn into giants from the Beta Box technology share almost similar characteristics to that of Titans in AoT even though it's probably just coincidence

\-Mefilas's name does sound like a demon's name

\-his obsession on mass producing the beta box for the entirerity of humanity

With all the bullet points above, how does Mefilas, fit the key as the demon that gave Ymir the Titan powers? and how is the titan powers basically just an early prototype of the Beta energy technology?

First up, we need to assume that Ymir DID actually meet the demon and that the demon did bestow her upon the powers of the Titan/Beta technology, and that Mefilas was on earth ever since the dawn of humanity. And also early Beta technology allows the Titan Shifters and mindless titans

Now here's where it becomes fanfic territory

Mefilas, on earth was finally done with the first prototype of Beta technology (he havent come out with the Beta Box yet) and he is looking for a subject to test the very first successful prototype he developed on a native of the planet. Which so happens to be the original Ymir. Mefilas will later on watch how the Beta technology prototype he first reverse engineered worked on humans from the shadows himself. Assuming that after the ending of AoT, civilisation progresses to where Shin Ultraman is at right now, Mefilas will spend more time to improve on Beta technology into the Beta box, which he was able to improvise from the first prototype, now making it so that even the fabric that the host is wearing will be part of the Titan's form as well, and not as deformed as before. Titan as a Beta technology prototype dosent seem too far off and feels like a natural technology progression.",3,1.0,2024-01-13 08:32:56,1,Detective_Joker

I wish I could go there but I'm on the other side of the country and will only have access to a Xenon presentation which is not even close to 1/4 the experience.

If you, like I, feel Canada never gets the cool rereleases in 70MM or great formats that other countries like US and UK get (seems like all the time!), I encourage you to show up to this one. It's an incredible movie experience and I wish I could be part of a crowd that want to send a message that we in Canada also consume this special events and are worth of getting more of them (imagine Interstellar, Batman, Dunkirk, Blade Runner 2049 and more, all in the best format available here in Canada!). Sad it's not the case specially IMAX being a Canadian creation.

When I saw it in 70MM IMAX it really was an incredible visual and sound experience with one of the best soundtracks ever made for a movie (second watch in that format was even better!). 
If you have the means and haven't watch it, don't miss this opportunity to do so and if you have seen it and loved it, support the rerelease to represent all of us that won't be able to show up due to distance or other factors.

Oppenheimer 4K digital code sneakily stolen,https://www.reddit.com/r/4kbluray/comments/192ws98/oppenheimer_4k_digital_code_sneakily_stolen/,"Got my teen son Oppenheimer 4K for Christmas because he‚Äôs a big fan of the movie.

Did I say unopened?

I could see from the edges that the case was shrink-wrapped beneath the cardboard slipcase. Slipped that guy out and the plastic was there‚Äîbut it had been opened along the case closure. I thought perhaps my son had started to open it and not finished, so I finished and pulled out the code slip.

And when I entered it, of course, it had already been redeemed, back in November before I bought it (physically from Target bc they had stock).

Redeemed, after the plastic was carefully removed, and then put back after, and then the slip cover back in place.

"Am I the only one, who felt Oppenheimer is insipid?",https://www.reddit.com/r/moviereviews/comments/193fsw9/am_i_the_only_one_who_felt_oppenheimer_is_insipid/,"Any art is a kind of medium that conveys an exciting idea in a mind to millions of minds. And if part of this attempt is successful, it would be a great masterpiece of art. Nolan has failed to convey that excitement since ""Tenet,"" and Oppenheimer has also clearly fizzled out in that endeavor. The most disappointing aspect is the screenplay, which will not give you a sense of excitement at any point as the movie progresses.

The movie is brimmed with endless dry dialogues, boring meetings in closed rooms, and frequently veers off into uninteresting subplots. But Nolan was successful in not letting the Oppenheimer character become supernatural throughout the movie.

You will be shown the amazing dialogue between officers behind closed doors to discuss which cities they are going to bomb rather than how the dropping of a bomb affected the unlucky cities of Japan in reality. Nolan preferred melodramatic events on the surface to the deeper story nobody knows, which made the plot dull and boring all the way.

The continuous saga of office discussions put me to near sleep, and that's when Nolan comes up with very loud music every now and then so that I don't have a chance to have a nice sleep.

As a final word, the screenplay was very flat, and I didn't feel excitement at any point. But someone who is a fan of endless closed room dialogue and drawing board discussions of making a bomb, this is the movie for you. If you expect some upbeat twists in the screenplay, sit back at your home, grab any book and coffee for a more enjoyable day.",3,0.67,2024-01-10 18:50:45,9,WhisperWizard

Its title was ‚ÄúOppenheimer vs Strauss‚Äù the edit was exceptional and the score was a mix of Oppenheimer and Interstellar.

It‚Äôs been taken down from YouTube, but wondering if anyone has it on another platform?

Critics Choice Predictions for the (theoretically) competitive categories,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/196lebk/critics_choice_predictions_for_the_theoretically/,"So I was going to post predictions for all categories like I normally do, but since almost all of them seem borderline locked, I‚Äôll only post the ones where I‚Äôm predicting an upset or that I feel require commentary. Everything not listed here that I‚Äôm predicting is #1 on [Goldderby](https://www.goldderby.com/odds/combined-odds/critics-choice-film-awards-2024-predictions/) and requires no explanation.

&#x200B;

**Best Supporting Actor**

**Ryan Gosling, Barbie**

(Alternate: Robert Downey Jr., Oppenheimer)

Gosling has such an insane amount of hype from Film Twitter and pundits that I think he‚Äôll be the rare instance of passion prevailing over the Oscar favourite. If he loses here then I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs likely done for the Oscar, there‚Äôs so little excuse it‚Äôs not even funny.

&#x200B;

**Best Adapted Screenplay**

**Oppenheimer**

(Alternate: American Fiction)

Poor Things just feels like too inspired of a lock for Critics Choice to go for. Oppenheimer‚Äôs the critics frontrunner in Adapted and this is an easy place to check it off. If something were to upset I‚Äôd bet on American Fiction since it does feel like the socially conscious/funny topical satire that CC tends to like.

&#x200B;

**Best Film Ensemble**

**Barbie**

(Alternate: Oppenheimer)

I was really close to swapping these two and even might have, but Goldderby closed before I could lol. Anyways, I noticed there‚Äôs been an extremely low correlation between Ensemble and Picture, the last one being Spotlight, which only got three awards total. Obviously, they‚Äôre gonna love Oppenheimer, but will they love it so much that they give it a win even here when Barbie is more to their tastes? 

I also think Colour Purple absolutely makes sense as a surprise winner, since it fits the profile of the also-ran like Glass Onion last year and has been doing decently in the category. Not gonna take the risk and go for it though because ~~Goldderby closed super early for no reason~~ it has been underperforming basically the entire season and I‚Äôm not totally convinced it will have the passion to overcome Barbenheimer here.

&#x200B;

**Best Comedy Film**

**Barbie**

(Alternate: American Fiction)

This award serves as a consolation for not necessarily the strongest comedy contender that‚Äôs not winning BP, but just seemingly the most comedic film that‚Äôs somewhat on the map awards-wise (ie Bridesmaids, Crazy Rich Asians, Glass Onion). But Bottoms and No Hard Feelings most definitely are not awards adjacent like those movies and none of the Barbie alternatives are capital-C comedies like they go for. American Fiction might be an exception to that but I haven‚Äôt been able to watch it and confirm as much, so I‚Äôm just gonna have it as my alternate.

&#x200B;

**Best Animated Film**

**Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse**

(Alternate: The Boy and the Heron)

Boy and the Heron‚Äôs Globe win could definitely give it momentum for voters here to think it‚Äôs the new frontrunner and thus vote for it, but it‚Äôs clear that CC voters lean a lot more mainstream and will probably just go for Spider-Verse. 

&#x200B;

**Best Song**

**‚ÄúI‚Äôm Just Ken,‚Äù Barbie**

Alternate: ‚ÄúWhat Was I Made For,‚Äù Barbie

Like Gosling the hype this has among Film Twitter types feels overwhelming, but in this case it‚Äôs even closer since they could easily just namecheck Eilish after the Globes win. Ultimately I still think the buzz around Barbie will duplicate here, since it seems like the people who love the movie go to Ken more than Made For.

&#x200B;

**Best Visual Effects**

**Oppenheimer**

(Alternate: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse)

TAR last year proved that voters will just check off their favourite movie in tech categories and I‚Äôd imagine many of them are just as, if not more apathetic to VFX. I could see a case for anything but Guardians and Mission: Impossible winning: Poor Things as the consolation prize, The Creator to predict the Oscars, and Spider-Verse as the surprise passion pick. Ultimately I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôll be much consensus and the strongest film will win.",7,0.74,2024-01-14 17:41:31,1,CrazyCons

Who is the #1 contender to Oppenheimer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/191xw4q/who_is_the_1_contender_to_oppenheimer/,"After the Globes last night, I think it is clear that Oppenheimer is still the heavy favorite to take home Best Picture at the Oscars. Oppenheimer won drama picture, Nolan won director, Murphy won Actor, and RDJ won supporting actor.

My question is, after Oppenheimer, who do you think stands the best chance to win?

My pick is The Holdovers. The Holdovers seems to have the best package of wins and nominees that it could very easily win picture if all of the cards fall the right way. The globes last night showed that The Holdovers can compete.

DJR looks like she is as locked as one can be in January to win Supporting Actress. The Holdovers is also the favorite to win Original Screenplay. Paul Giamatti is also looking like a contender for Best Actor. This package of wins with a little momentum built up at SAG and other precursors could just beat Oppenheimer on Oscars night.

What are your thoughts?",32,0.86,2024-01-08 22:20:01,56,maddennate1

Can thought be understood and be shattered against its own nothingness? Through careful examination we look at our lives, the state of the world, the potential of complete annihilation by a nuclear holocaust. 

Do we human beings have the capacity for this explosion of meditation? Or do we remain in the same field and direction as Oppenheimer's invention? 

In the movie Oppenheimer, it's put to the scientist if he can ""hear the music"" referring to, in my interpretation, seeing the whole field of his specific scientific field, and connecting the dots of all that knowledge. 

In a similar way, can we listen to ourselves? Our whole field of what we are, objectively, without motive?",30,0.94,2024-01-14 01:39:28,13,Artistic-Click4561

This is your reminder to watch Oppenheimer especially if you didn't catch it in the cinema,https://www.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk/comments/1923hhm/this_is_your_reminder_to_watch_oppenheimer/," Oppenheimer is one of those movies that kinda flew under the radar, while still very much not flying under the radar if that makes sense.

Every major YouTube reviewer talked about it, most people had at least heard about it, it made descent money, but man, it's too good compared how little a dent it made in Pop culture.

Most people I know haven't seen it. And finding one who has is like finding your best friend at an event you didn't know both of you were going to.

It's a colorful, fun, emotional, and fast ride through japan. Excellently shot. With an insanely good cast, and some pretty good pondering on the nature of unknowable forces such as luck and fate.

A mystery that just keeps going, and plot that never stops and characters that live rent free in my mind and heart.

If you like style AND substance. Oppenheimer is for you.",556,0.98,2024-01-09 02:25:29,51,littlelordfROY

Critical discussion of many of 2023's films is completely hampered by horrid distribution,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/19760md/critical_discussion_of_many_of_2023s_films_is/,"This is sort of a rant/business observation, but 2023 was an absolutely astounding year for film, no doubt. It was astounding film after astounding film and discussions around awards have been diverse and pretty interesting (despite the few obvious front runners). 

But trying to discuss many of these films with people (online or in person) has been nigh impossible because outside the few big films in the mix, most haven't been seen by anyone. Has anyone else noticed this? Do you feel (wherever you live) that you've been offered the chance to see many of the raved about films?

*Oppenheimer*, *Killers of the Flower Moon*, *Past Lives*, *The Holdovers* all got very wide releases. But *Anatomy of a Fall* got a pretty narrow release but it's at least out there in a pretty wide range of cities for a film of its kind, *Zone of Interest* barely exists outside the festival circuit unless you live in a major metropolitan city, and I'm not even sure if *La Chimera* or *Perfect Days* really exist at all. 

A24 has had a pretty questionable year with its distribution, but Neon has been utterly atrocious. I saw their tweet recently about their lineup and thought ""Many of these are serious awards or Oscars contenders!"" But they just do not get a release. 

It's always been the case that certain movies get a festival release, a lot of buzz and praise, then sort of vanish for a year before appearing silently on streaming. That's not that abnormal. But I really feel 2023 has been an outlier in **how many** films that are absolutely stunning and receiving *overwhelmingly rave reviews* just vanish after the festival circuit (and maybe a small smattering of screenings elsewhere). 

I'm sure there's complex strategic and economic reasons behind these decisions. Or at least I really hope there is. But it is frustrating that an enormous part of our cultural discussion around film is restricted to a small handful of ""blockbuster art"", because only a select few elites (academics, film critics, or circuit pundits) ever get to see a bunch of the rest. I live in Edinburgh Scotland currently. A pretty notable city, with a major world-class University, enormous international tourism & student body, and a huge arts scene. But most of these films haven't even had Edinburgh releases yet. It's just bizarre (or if they did, it's like... 2 and they're instantly booked out).",53,0.91,2024-01-15 10:52:50,9,Sleepy_C
"Thomas Flight's ""Big Thoughts"" on Objectivity vs Subjectivity",https://www.reddit.com/r/MauLer/comments/196m34q/thomas_flights_big_thoughts_on_objectivity_vs/,"I hope this is covered in a future EFAP episode because it's \*really\* bad for an essayist withThomas Flight's reach to confuse first/third person perspectives with objectivity/subjectivity(\*1).

[https://youtu.be/qsxdFNaEqBk?si=sRYxR-ux3dVk2JKm](https://youtu.be/qsxdFNaEqBk?si=sRYxR-ux3dVk2JKm)

It's even worse because I thought it was another ""Barbenheimmer"" video that was released months later to avoid being seen as part of the fad (a la YMS's Little Mermaid Live Action review), but it was actually clickbait!  It even tries to compare stunts between the latest Mission Impossible films based on ""perspective"".

\*Note 1: this means Flight is either ignorant of these fundamental terms, or he is trying to convince you that this interpretation is correct so he'll believe it too.

And a sad 2nd postscript: this isn't Flight's own idea: it was [Christopher Nolan](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a44078733/oppenheimer-black-and-white-sequences-christopher-nolan/) who confused objectivity vs subjectivity.
