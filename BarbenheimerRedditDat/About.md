# Information About the Data

The data was collected using the Reddit API. I searched the "r/movies" subreddit for the terms: barbie, oppenheimer, and barbenheimer.
posts were sorted by "hot" using cloudsearch method.

Included is the post title, body, date, and author. The same information is avalibable for comments and replies. 
The post column is duplicated for each reply and each post and comment data was duplicated for the reply.

Three data files:

3. Barbenheimer_Reddit_Replies.csv: Posts, comments, and replies to comments in thread.
